Sliding Panel is a lightweight, unobtrusive, yet extremely useful and effective jQuery plugin.

Its goal is to provide a simple way to turn any DOM element into a retractable, sliding panel. It was created to fulfill the need of showing examples on unoome (in french only for the moment), a service aimed at small/medium enterprises/associations with no IT skill to easily create websites. So a really easy and intuitive help was needed, and that's how Sliding Panel was born.

Hopefully, it was designed with extensibility in mind, so you can use it not only to display help or examples, but also to display anything you want : an options panel for example. Just call :
View Raw Code?

    $(your_DOM_element).slidingPanel();

And you're ready to go. The flexibility given by the settings should allow you to tune the plugin the way you like. Of course, it comes with a default CSS, but you can customize it to make it fit your needs.
