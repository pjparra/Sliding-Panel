<div id="panel">
	From now, Sliding Panel can be finely positionned. 
	The position parameter determines on which side 
	of your container the panel will be. <br/>
	The offset parameter allows you to fine tune the position, 
	relatively to the sides you wish. You could, for example, 
	use position: 'right' and offset: {top: '100px'} to make it appear 
	on the right side, 100px from the top. Have a try !
